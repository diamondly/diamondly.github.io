                <p>
                    I am a Senior at Cal State Fullerton and will be graduating in Spring 2024 with a Bachelor's
                    degree in Computer Science. I also currently work as a Student Assistant for Women in 
                    Computer Science & Engineering (WiCSE).
                    <br> <br>
                    My interest in programming sparked in 2017 when I enrolled in an AP Computer Science Principles
                    course at my high school during my senior year. I enjoyed building programs and games out of lines of code! 
                    While I have learned different programming languages over the years, I would say the language I 
                    am currently the most comfortable is Python.
                    <br> <br>
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing games, hanging out with friends, and watching movies & TV shows.
                </p>
