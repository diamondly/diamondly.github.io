        <h1>Criminal Chase</h1>
        <div id="diamond">
            <p>You are a wanted criminal who just stole some cash! Jump over obstacles in your way to escape because your life depends on it! Watch out though. These cars can come at you fast.
<br></br>
<br>Use the right and left arrow keys to move right or left. Use the up arrow key to jump</br></p>

    <h3>1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h3>
    <p>Some programming concepts or structure applied to my game would be the if-else statements, event handling, and algorithms. The if-else statements and algorithms allowed for the sprite to be able to move left and right. For example, I made it that if the right arrow key is pressed, then the sprite's x-position will change by 10. 
    If the left arrow key is pressed, the sprite's x-position will change by -10. Another important algorithm would be the movement of the car. It is similar to the algorithm of the sprite, except the movement of the car is randomized and can only head along the negative x-axis. These two algorithms serve as the foundation and contribute
    to the concept of the game. </p>

    <h3>2. Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h3>
    <p>A problem or struggle that I encountered while working on this project would be increasing the difficulty of the game. While trying to increase the difficulty of the game by adding multiple obstacles, the obstacles (a fire hydrant and a blue car) kept getting stuck at a certain point for unknown reasons. 
    As a solution, I decided to remove the two obstacles and replaced it by increasing the speed of the gray car after the player reaches a certain distance. I also included one more obstacle, the trashcan, which appears after the player reaches a distance of at least 5000.</p>

    <h3>3. What aspects of your game do you like best?</h3>
    <p>One of the aspects of my game that I like the best would be the moving car featured on the home page since it gives the player a clue as to what's to come. Another aspect of the game that I like would be the use of music and sound. By using the sound "dance around" from Scratch as the main theme song of the game, it provides a cheerful
    and uplifting atmosphere for the player. By also adding sound effects to whenever the player crashes into obstacles like the car or trash can, it makes the game more fun and immersive.</p>

    <h3>4. If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h3>
    <p>If more time was given for me to work on my game, I would definitely improve the jump mechanic of the character and work on increasing the difficulty of the game by adding more obstacles.</p>
