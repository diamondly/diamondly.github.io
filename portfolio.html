            <p>Synopsis: You are an employee of a company who helps grants the wishes of elders on their deathbeds by traversing their memories and changing them to meet their wish.
            You are assigned to a patient named Xavier who wants you to grant his wish of having happy memories without any regrets. How much of his past will you change?</p>
            <p>1)Some programming structures or concepts that I learned in this unit that I applied to my story would be the while loop and if-else statements. These programming structures and concepts 
            helped us create different choices and pathways that the player can take.</p>
            <p>2)A story that I particularly liked would be Ben's story. It had an interesting plot that made you question your morality through the choices given to you and endings you received.
            It was very detailed and original!</p>
